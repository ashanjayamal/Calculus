Definition 3.2 (Right Limit) We write \\(\\lim_{{x \\to c^+}} f(x) = L\\) if the number \\(f(x)\\) (the function height) keeps getting close to \\(L\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\) from the right. } Left Limit and Right Limit are called one-sided limits. Definition 3.3 (Two-sided Limit) We write \\(\\lim_{{x \\to c}} f(x) = L\\) if the number \\(f(x)\\) (the function height) keeps getting close to the same value \\(L\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\) from either direction. Theorem 3.1 The two-sided limit \\[\\lim_{{x \\to c}} f(x)\\] exists if and only if the two one-sided limits \\[\\lim_{{x \\to c^-}} f(x) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{{x \\to c^+}} f(x)\\] both exist and are equal. Furthermore, if \\[\\lim_{{x \\to c^-}} f(x) = L \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{{x \\to c^+}} f(x) = L\\] then \\[\\lim_{{x \\to c}} f(x) = L.\\] ``{example,name=‘Evaluating limits using a graph’ For each of the following functions, write down the left limit, right limit, two-sided limit, and the function value at the given point. If any limit is undefined, write \"UND\". - at \\(x = 4\\) at \\(x = 3\\) at \\(x = 3\\) at \\(x = 3\\) ```{Remark} In Example 3.1.5 part (a), you can observe that the limit (two-sided limit) at $x = 2$ is equal to the function value at that point. In part (d), you can observe that the limit (two-sided limit) at $x = 3$ is different from the function value at that point. In general, there is no connection between the limit of a function at a point ($\\lim_{{x \\to c}} f(x)$) and the value of the function ($f(c)$) at that point. Example 3.1 Observing the table, we can say there is a good chance that \\[\\lim_{{x \\to 0}} f(x) = 2.\\] One cannot use a table to calculate the limit exactly (Why?). Example 3.2 The following figure shows the graph of \\(f(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\). Observe that \\[\\lim_{{x \\to 0}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\] is undefined. Figure 3.1: Graph of \\(f(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\). The graph is better than the table when we use Definition 3.1. In this course, we stick with Definition 3.1. It’s not rigorous enough; you will learn the formal \\(\\epsilon - \\delta\\) definition listed below in advanced math classes. Definition 3.4 Let \\(f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(L \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). We say that the limit of \\(f\\) at \\(c\\) is \\(L\\) and denote it by \\[\\lim_{{x \\to c}} f(x) = L,\\] if for each \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\) such that: \\[|x - c| &lt; \\delta \\Rightarrow |f(x) - L| &lt; \\epsilon.\\] 3.2 Continuity In the most basic sense, a continuous function can be sketched in one continuous stroke without lifting a pen or pencil. We would need to lift our pencil in drawing a function because it has a jump or hole in its graph. If there is a jump or hole in the graph, at that point, either the limit or function value is undefined, or they take different values. This leads to the following definition. Definition 3.5 (Continuity at a point) We say a function is continuous at a point \\(x = c\\), if the number \\(f(x)\\) (the function height) keeps getting close to \\(f(c)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\) from either direction. A function that is not continuous at \\(c\\) is said to have a discontinuity at that point. Following theorem is straightforward. Theorem 3.2 (Continuity theorem I) A function \\(f\\) is continuous at a point \\(x = c\\) if the following conditions are satisfied: \\(f(c)\\) is defined; \\(\\lim_{{x \\to c}} f(x)\\) is defined; \\(\\lim_{{x \\to c}} f(x) = f(c)\\). Example 3.3 For each of the following functions, state whether the function is continuous at the given point. If not, state which condition of continuity is broken at that point. at \\(x = 4\\) at \\(x = 2\\) at \\(x = 2\\) at \\(x = 3\\) Definition 3.6 (Continuity of a function) A function is continuous on a set \\(X\\) if it is continuous at every point of \\(X\\). Definition 3.7 Let \\(f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(c\\) if for each \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\) such that: \\[|x - c| &lt; \\delta \\Rightarrow |f(x) - f(c)| &lt; \\epsilon.\\] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
